I have a Ph.D. in Genome Science and Technology and a Master’s in Statistics from the University of Tennessee-Knoxville. Currently, I am a postdoctoral associate at the Jackson Laboratory working in Dr. Gregory Carter’s laboratory. I am wet and dry systems biologist that investigates systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, lupus) using multiple -omics, multiple tissues, and potential therapeutics to tease out the molecular underpinnings that contribute to SLE progression.\nAdditionally, I am a proponent of open science and developing novel ways of disseminating research that is transparent and reproducible while simultaneously bridging the gap between traditional and computational biologists.\nOutside of research I want to empower non-computational biologists to obtain the computational skills necessary to perform preliminary analyses on their own data. I do this through teaching and have also become a software carpentry instructor.\nWhen I’m not thinking about science I am often riding my bike on the beautiful park loop in Acadia National Park, going for hikes, working out, or generally enjoying the amazing island I live on.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "title": "Bridging the Gap Between Traditional and Computational Biologists Through Open Science",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I believe that open science can be used to bridge the gap between traditional and computational biologists. Current approaches often result in large data dumps and sharing scripts, which are difficult to reproduce, time consuming, and are often missing key pieces of information for full transparency.\nI developed a system that combines data analysis and links to other platforms that house code, data, shiny apps, and anything else you would like to be available. All of these components for a singular project are then packaged into a website that acts as a one stop shop for a research project.\nBuilding these websites has improved several aspects of my research and data analysis process:\n\nThey make it easier to talk with collaborators and share results in an intuitive way.\nThey make it easier to understand the outcome of an experiment and organize data in a way that will be accessible years after the project is complete.\nThey don’t require traditional biologists to understand your code but empower them to understand the steps of analysis that have been taken to arrive at an outcome creating richer discussions.\nAt the end of a project they can easily be publicly hosted for other researchers to investigate the entire analysis that was completed, not just what was presented in the accompanying journal article.\n\n\nData Resource Accompanying the paper: Transcriptome Analysis Reveals Organ‑Specific Effects of 2‑Deoxyglucose Treatment in Healthy Mice\n\n\n\nHomepage\n\n\nAnn E.
